# Notification Sound

✅ The notification sound file (`notification.mp3`) is now in place!

The sound will be played when:
- You receive a new message (when window is not focused)
- You receive a @mention
- You receive a direct message

## Features
- Plays at 50% volume by default
- Automatically loaded by the notification system
- Works with browser notifications

## Customization
To use a different notification sound, simply replace `notification.mp3` with your own audio file (keep the same filename). Recommended duration: 0.5-1 second.
